# vue-snap
> Lightweight Slider/Carousel based on CSS Scroll Snap.

## About
Please note that this lib is on very early stage. The idea behind this plugin is that to create fully responsive and well optimised Carousel. I created this as PoC for one of my biggest client, who wants to speed up his website.

## Benefits:
- Lightweight (5-10x times lighter than other libs)
